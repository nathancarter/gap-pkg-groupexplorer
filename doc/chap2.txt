  feature available when a group has been loaded from an external source, such
  as  [5XGAP[105X.  A  search  icon  will  appear  in  the  top-right  corner  of  the
  visualization  window,  and  clicking  it will search for the group in Group
  Explorer's  library. If it is found, then Group Explorer will open its Group
  Info  Page  for  that  group,  which shows all the visualization options and
  group-related facts Group Explorer knows about the group, as documented here
  ([7Xhttps://nathancarter.github.io/group-explorer/help/rf-um-groupwindow/[107X).  If

  [1X2.10 [33X[0;0YSize limitations[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  mentioned  in the introduction, there are limitations inherent in a two-
  or three-dimensional visual representation readable by a human. Groups above
  a  certain  size  and  level of complexity reveal less of their structure in
  such  representations,  because  there's only so much space available before
  elements become very tiny, or occlude one another.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  an  example,  consider  the  group  from  [5XGAP[105X's  Small  Groups  library,
  [10XSmallGroup(   150,   5   )[110X.   If   we   invoke   each   of   the   functions
  [2XExploreCayleyDiagram[102X     ([14X3.1-4[114X),     [2XExploreCycleDiagram[102X    ([14X3.1-5[114X),    and
  [2XExploreMultiplicationTable[102X  ([14X3.1-3[114X) on that group, we see the visualizations
  shown below.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YResulting image not shown here.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YObviously,  from this Cayley graph, we can see only that the group has three
  generators and is not abelian. Other than that, most of its structure is too
  complex to read.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YResulting image not shown here.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFrom  this  cycle  graph,  we can see roughly how many groups there are with
  small  orbits  and  with  larger orbits, and how some of those larger orbits
  overlap.  But  without  zooming  to see the names of the elements, we cannot
  tell  much  more.  (Viewing  the  graph  in  Group Explorer permits zooming,
