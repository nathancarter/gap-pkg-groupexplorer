  [33X[0;0YThe desktop group theory visualization software Group Explorer was ported to
  the      web      in     2019.     It     is     available     online     at
  [7Xhttps://nathancarter.github.io/group-explorer[107X.       It       has       some
  software-as-a-service  features  that  let  its  pages  be  opened  by other
  applications,  with  parameters  indicating  which  groups to display and in
  which ways. This package provides a [5XGAP[105X API for doing exactly that.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YGroup  Explorer has many features that this package does not expose, because
  its  primary  intended  use  case  is  (as  the  name  suggests) interactive
  exploration    of    visualizations    (rather    than    generating    them
  programmatically).  The  reader  may  wish to investigate the Group Explorer
  manual ([7Xhttps://nathancarter.github.io/group-explorer/help/[107X) for a full list
  of its features.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe subset of those features exposed by this package include:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ydisplaying a multiplication table for a given group[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ydisplaying a Cayley graph for a given group[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ydisplaying a cycle graph for a given group[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yletting  the user interact with any of these visualizations after they
        have been displayed[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThese visualizations have natural limitations; it becomes impossible to gain
  any  benefit  from,  for  example,  a  Cayley graph that is so huge that its
  structure  is  unreadable  to  the  human  eye.  And the computer would have
  difficulty  constructing  and  rendering  such  an object as well. Thus this
  package's utility decreases with group size, roughly as follows.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ygroups of order 1-30: ideal[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ygroups of order 31-60: still useful[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ygroups  of  order  61-200:  renderable  but not very useful (as in the
        example in Section [14X2.10[114X)[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ygroups of order 201+: slow to render, not very useful[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote that Group Explorer is a separate application from this package, and if
  bugs  are  discovered  within Group Explorer, they should be reported on its
  issue  tracker  on GitHub, rather than within the issue tracker for this [5XGAP[105X
  package.  Bugs  for  this  package's  connection  to  Group  Explorer can be
  reported to this package's issue tracker.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  remaining  sections of this chapter cover some illustrative examples to
  help   get   you   started   using   the  package.  Comprehensive  reference
  documentation  for  the  few  functions  exposed  by  the package appears in
  Chapter [14X3[114X.[133X
