# To-do list

## Tasks that will enable me to declare version 0.9.0

 * Add an option to the "more" parameter of `ExploreGroup` that tells it
   to just return the record it creates rather than calling
   `CreateVisualization` on it, so that we can add much more thorough
   testing of the package.  Then add that testing.

## Tasks that will enable me to declare version 1.0.0

 * Ask others to check over this package and give bug feedback.
 * When testing complete, run ReleaseTools to generate the first release.

## Miscellaneous tasks

 * Add a feature to Group Explorer so that if it is displaying a group
   that was loaded from `waitForMessage` with an explicit multiplication
   table, it will let the user search for that group in the built-in GE
   library, and will let the user switch to that representation.
