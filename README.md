# Group Explorer GAP Package

This package allows [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org) users to create
visualizations of groups using [Group Explorer
3.0](https://nathancarter.github.io/group-explorer/index.html).

## Status

Right now this project is a proof-of-concept.  It works but it's still quite
disorganized, and its API will be changing as I improve it and make it much
more polished.  Check back soon.
